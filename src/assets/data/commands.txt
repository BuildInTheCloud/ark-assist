type	string	Entity ID to summon
level	string	Level w/o taming bonus
Spawn a creature of the specified type at the place of the player character and tames it.
The dino isn't cheat-tamed, so still requires a saddle. The level is without taming bonus, so if you want to end with a level x you should divide that number by 1.5. E.g. you want level 150, that is 150 / 1.5 = 100. You type 100 and the result is 100 plus 50% taming bonus: 150.

GMSummon "Dodo_Character_BP_C" 100

This command is a general command that affects many different graphics settings, all of which will be set to the new value (rounding if necessary).

If you select a player in the connected player's list, you can easily copy their UE4 player ID (a 10 digit number) into a command's parameters for commands that require a player ID. Supposedly you should also be able to copy their Int64 encoded Steam ID for commands that require it, but it seems to be broken at the moment.
